Tic-Tac-Toe Game via Java

This Java program creates a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Swing, GUI development, event handling, and user interaction.

The TicTacToe class handles the game logic and GUI. It creates a window with a title panel and a grid of buttons representing the game board.
Players take turns clicking buttons to place their symbol (X or O). After each move, the game checks for win conditions.
If a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted, and the game declares the winner. If all cells are filled without a win, the game ends in a draw.
